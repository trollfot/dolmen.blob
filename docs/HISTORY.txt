Changelog
=========

0.2 (2009-10-23)
----------------

* Added a bunch of new tests for the compatibility with the new
  packages used.

* A new access view is available for `IBlobFile` objects, returning a
  `zope.file.download.DownloadResult`. This access view also uses
  an adapter to `zope.mimetype.interfaces.IContentInfo` to get the
  header values.

* `IBlobFile` now inherits from `zope.file.interfaces.IFile`. This
  brings in a lot of new features, including the compatibility with
  the `zope.mimetype` package and its adapters.

* `dolmen.blob` now proposes a non `Persistent` blob, called
  BlobValue. It allows to have object storing an attribute value in a
  blob, without getting an independant connection to the database
  (Blob already do that). The BlobProperty uses this new component
  now.
