Changelog
=========

0.2 (2009-10-23)
----------------

* Added a bunch of new tests for the compatibility with the new
  packages used.

* A new access view is available for the `IBlobFile` returning a
  DownloadResult object, from `zope.file`. This access view also uses
  the `IContentInfo` adapter, to get the header values.

* `IBlobFile` now inherits `from zope.file.interfaces.IFile`. This
  brings in a lot of new features, including the compatibility with
  the `zope.mimetype` and its adapters.

* `dolmen.blob` now proposes a non Persistent blob, called
  BlobValue. It allows to have object storing an attribute value in a
  blob, without getting an independant connection to the database
  (Blob already do that). The BlobProperty uses this new component
  now.


0.1 (2009-10-19)
